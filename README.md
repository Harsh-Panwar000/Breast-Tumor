# Tumor-Classifier

The goal of this model is to use the KNN Classifier algorithm to categorize breast tumor as malignant or benign.

The data was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29
**The original data was slightly modified into the data available in this repository by adding labels on the first line**

The attributes of the turmor are as follows:

"1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)"

The highest accuracy observed was 98%.
